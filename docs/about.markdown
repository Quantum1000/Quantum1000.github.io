I'm Shenna Summerfelt, a 26 year old CS graduate with wide interests. I specialize in AI, and I have gotten fairly deep into that and intend to do more, but really I'm more of a generalist. My interests include but are not limitied to: materials science, synthetic biology, manufacturing, automation, space infrastructure, networking, and robotics. I have broad and perhaps unexpectedly deep knowledge of all of my interests, but in most of them I'd still consider myself a beginner, although I have done entry level projects in AI, synthetic biology, and robotics, which you should be able to find on the main page. While this site is intended for a professional audience, if you just want to chat with me, I also game regularly, prefering automation games, FPS and strategy, and read quite a lot of manga and web novels (mainly on RoyalRoad).

### About this site

This website is currently serving as my portofolio, and will continue to, barring any unexpected events. I've had ideas for other things I could put here, tools or apps or writing, that are for different audiences, but at this time nothing is planned.
