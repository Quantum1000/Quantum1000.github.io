For a long time I've dreamed of fractal patterns reminiscent of nature for decorating buildings and objects. It's always seemed a shape to me that patterns typically are designed to be viewed all at once, and even buildings which are often viewed closer are boring and repetetive when seen up close. I developed the algorithm used by the rust program in the github in blender geometry nodes originally, before porting it to rust to allow more algorithmic flexibility in anticipation of future changes, and higher performance.
